<h1>My dog is the best</h1>
<p>My dog is a barking mad, brown ball of fluff and she makes us all laugh on a daily basis until she does something stupid to the extreme where she runs head first into <span class='important'> a tree </span> and collapses... she was fine, she's just a massive wuss!</p>
